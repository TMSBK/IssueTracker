Project Submission

Steps to complete the project


1. Fork and clone the starter repository. The code in this repository will serve as your baseline to begin     development. DONE
    1. From inside the new directory, launch a local client server using Python from your terminal: 
    Python 2: python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 DONE
    Python 3: python3 -m http.server 8000 DONE
    2. Visit the site in your browser at http://localhost:8000 DONE
2. Convert the provided site to use a responsive design .
    1. Bootstrap and other CSS frameworks should not be used; all responsiveness should be done with CSS.
    2. Use appropriate document type declaration and viewport tags DONE
    3. Create a responsive grid-based layout using CSS DONE
    4. Use media queries that provide fluid breakpoints across different screen sizes DONE
    5. Use responsive images that adjust for the dimensions and resolution of any mobile device DONE



3. Implement accessibility features in the site HTML (most of this HTML is generated by JavaScript             functions).



4. Add a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been     visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline. Only caching needs to be implemented, no     other ServiceWorker features.

Consult the rubric often to be sure you are meeting the specific project requirements.
